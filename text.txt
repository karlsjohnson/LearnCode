Love the LORD, all his faithful people! The LORD preserves those who are true to him, but the proud he pays back in full. 24 Be strong and take heart, all you who hope in the LORD - Psalm 31:23-24

“For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.” - Isaiah 9:6

Our mission is to partner with the people of Sierra Leone to restore their communities knowing that Christ will transform the lives of everyone involved. #africa #sierraleone #thebridgeofhopeus #donate

Our vision: We envision Sierra Leone as a place where its people have access to the basic needs of life, where they are healthy, equipped and empowered to support themselves and find purpose in serving others. #africa #sierraleone #thebridgeofhopeus #donate

Who we serve: Makambo is a small village in Sierra Leone near Makeni. New Life Fellowship in Graham, Washington and Soma Communities in Tacoma, Washington joined together to build a small school and support a church in Makambo named Soma Communities.  They also added a sanitation system that includes a well, and several bathrooms. #africa #sierraleone #thebridgeofhopeus #donate #Makambo

Your generous hearts throughout the year have blessed beyond measure the children and families of Sierra Leone. You, the donors and sponsors of The Bridge Of Hope, have changed lives all year and provided HOPE to a place where hope can be rare. Thank you for your support! May God bless you this week as you celebrate a time of Thanksgiving. May you know how much you are truly appreciated. #africa #sierraleone #thebridgeofhopeus #thankyou #thanksgiving

Yes...there is a New York area of Sierra Leone!  When our lead pastor handed over the reigns of the Makambo church, he began to plan a new church in this area that is closer to the city.  Land is more expensive and difficult you get the closer you are to the city.  One of The Bridge preschool caretakers has loaned her family land so that a temporary church structure could be put in place in this village area.  It is a growing church with lots of potential!  We are so thankful for the "widow's mite" that allowed them to put this structure on her family land.  Please pray for her and for this church as they strive to get their own land and building some day!

Who we serve: The first community started is in the area of Makama which is in Makeni, Sierra Leone. Partnering with the people in this community, we first built a church.  School started in that church and later we built a school so that individual classrooms could provide a better environment for children to learn. Over 400 students attend this school and receive free education and one meal a day. We also built a small medical clinic in the school building where our Bridge students, teachers and family members can visit and get free medical care.  Child sponsorship allows us to provide this education and food as well as help out with school supplies. #africa #sierraleone #thebridgeofhopeus #donate #Makama

Who we serve: Masuba village is on the outskirts of Makeni.  It is an area where one of The Bridge pastors has planted a church and with his own initiative and the help of villagers, they acquired land and built a temporary structure.  After a couple of years we were able to help them build a permanent structure so the church can grow and the building will last through the monsoon season.  #africa #sierraleone #thebridgeofhopeus #donate #Masuba

Who we serve: Rosint is a village on the outskirts of Makeni. There was a small school in this village that was struggling to continue. The Bridge has now adopted this community and built them a church near the school that will also be used for additional classrooms.  The land is beautiful in this area and several farming projects have been started in the area to help the pastor and other church members in the community. #africa #sierraleone #thebridgeofhopeus #donate #rosint

Who we serve: Rohpolon Village has been a part of The Bridge for many years.  The church used to meet in a borrowed classroom.  They have been moved many times in their years.  But under the strong leadership of Pastor Pious, they came together on their own and built a temporary structure on borrowed land.  That structure has allowed them to meet as a church for the last two years, but the land owner wanted his land back.  So the church came together and after selling some belongings, they had enough money to buy some land.  When the folks at Christ’s Church in Federal Way heard about this, they came together and raised funds so we could build them their permanent structure (using our Dwell Earth bricks!). #africa #sierraleone #thebridgeofhopeus #donate #rosint

For us in the developed world, this word means little. Mumps is simply a part of our childhood vaccination record, alongside Measles and Rubella. But to children like Salima in Sierra Leone, it can be a death sentence. We are so thankful for our local partnerships who made it possible to get Salima the treatment she needed after she was seen in our Makambo medical clinic. #africa #sierraleone #thebridgeofhopeus #medical #donate

Urgent need for life-saving antivenom. Last year with your help, The Bridge opened Sierra Leone’s first ever snakebite treatment center to address a desperate need. We would love to keep our snakebite clinic open and continue this life-saving care in Sierra Leone, but we need your help. Any donation will go directly to the purchase of antivenom and in turn, save lives in West Africa.  Would you be willing to donate today? The donation link is in our Bio. Thank you! #africa #sierraleone #thebridgeofhopeus #snakebites #donate

Background of Sierra Leone: The country achieved independence in 1961. Competition among rival groups finally opened into the Sierra Leone Civil War (1991 to 2002), which devastated the country. It left more than 50,000 people dead, much of the country's infrastructure destroyed, and over two million people displaced as refugees in neighboring countries. #africa #sierraleone #thebridgeofhopeus #learn #serve

It takes a variety of gifts and services from willing volunteers for us to continue our work alongside our Sierra Leone friends.  God does not need us, but allows us to be a part of the work He is doing to transform lives on both sides of the bridge. Not all people are called to go to Sierra Leone but are still called to serve this ministry.  We have many volunteers needs from office support, to event planning, to sewing! #africa #sierraleone #thebridgeofhopeus #volunteer

Millions of children are living in poverty. Hunger is an everyday struggle that weakens them. Unclean water makes them sick. Without an education they won't reach their potential. One in five kids will die before their fifth birthday this year — most from preventable causes` like water-borne illnesses, malaria and malnutrition. #africa #sierraleone #thebridgeofhopeus #makambo #school #secondary #child #sponsor

What will sponsoring a child do? Your 67 cents a day will go a long way in providing for a child in need. Sponsored children are provided access to life-saving basics like: an education, a daily nutritious meal, first aid care, clean water, and more! #africa #sierraleone #thebridgeofhopeus #makambo #school #secondary #child #sponsor

“I believe that through God, all things are possible. Improving the health of my community is not an exception to this. Let us work together to make this dream a reality.” Salamatu Bangura, Nurse for The Bridge of Hope in Sierra Leone #africa #sierraleone #thebridgeofhopeus #medical #donate

The Bridge of Hope Medical Team aspires to help create a self-sustainable medical system in Sierra Leone, which is available to all. We strive to do so by partnering with local healthcare providers to implement a framework for preventative care, and to encourage healthy habits through education. When implementing new programs in country, we use the “train the trainer” method in order to take further steps towards sustainability. We believe that all humans have equal value, and access to healthcare is a basic human right. #africa #sierraleone #thebridgeofhopeus #medical

Hammed Conteh was born into poverty in the village of Makambo in Sierra Leone, Africa. He was sponsored by a loving woman who has spent many years caring for him, loving him, and reminding him that he is valued. In 2020, Hammed completed his primary education and became eligible for secondary school. In the past, graduating from class six was the highest educational achievement possible, BUT THIS HAS CHANGED!!! Because of donors and sponsors like you, enough funding was raised to complete the phase of our secondary school project required to open the doors for the next class. GOD IS GOOD. ALL THE TIME!
